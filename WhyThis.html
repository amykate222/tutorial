  <h1>  How will this skill change my life and my career?</h1>
  <p>I am not expecting a raise, but I am hoping to gain more base knowledge. I feel like I am lacking some basics that others have.  I also am hoping to learn fundementals so evaluating things like Mongo DB make sense.  It's also been 20+ years since I've been in college and things have certainly changed.  I haven't done a great job at keeping up!</p>
  <h1> How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,friends and coworkers?</h1>
  <p>Again, I am hoping to garner more respect from co workers, mainly BK and team</p>
   <h1> How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h1>
<p>Since this is my day job, I hope that I know more than I thought.  I also feel like this instructor will be good enough and structured enough to keep my interest.  If I fail, I will be mightily dissappointed</p>
   <h1>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h1>
  <p>It will look a lot like it would now, except that I won't feel as insecure about my position and what I don't know.  That will allow me to relax more at work for sure</p>
